## Weekly Project (Total 10 points)
Using Sublime, create a program that will give a user the option to count by printing in the console or add/subtract two numbers. Continue doing this until they enter 'q'.

### Phase 1

#### Ask the user to enter to enter an option, then go to that option (2 points):
Example:
"Welcome to Kenn's program. Press 1 to count. Press 2 to use a calculator. Press q to quit".

#### When selecting count by pressing 1 (2 points):
Ask the user to count by ones.
- If they select count by ones, ask them to enter a number. Start at 1 and count up to that number in the console log.

#### When selecting use a calculator by pressing 2 (2 points):
Ask the user if they want to use addition.
- If they select 'a', ask them to enter two numbers. Give them the sum of the numbers.

### Phase 2
#### When selecting count by pressing 1 (2 points):
Ask the user to count by twos.
- If they select count by twos, ask them to enter a number. Start at 1 and count up to that number in the console log by twos.

#### When selecting use a calculator by pressing 2 (2 points):
Ask the user if they want to use subtraction.
- If they select 's', ask them to enter two numbers. Give them the difference of the numbers.

### Challenge
- Ask the user to input the starting number when counting by ones and twos.
- Make sure if the user enters an invalid selection say "ERROR", then retry the question. This should include an ERROR when a user inserts a smaller second number when counting in the above challenge.

#### Notes
- It's expected you know how to use Git to push and pull your projects. You will not get ANY points if you push your work after 5pm.
